This application and the charger itself are amazing products. I only open the app when I need to find my car. It always has the location stored. I never have to think about it when I park my car. It just works. 

Application interface is fantastic and the charges my iPad with no problem.

I bought assuming it was going to be another gimmicky accessory. Was I wrong. I'd buy another but I only have one car :)"

Man kann gleichzeitig zwei Geräte aufladen, für die das Gerät die jeweils optimale Ladespannung herstellt (bei mir iPhone und Kindle oder iPad). Wenn Bluetooth eingeschaltet ist, sendet das Ladegrät die genauen Standortdaten automatisch an die App, was wiederum bedeutet, dass man sein Auto auch wiederfindet, wenn man sich verlaufen hat.
Die Autobatterie-Anzeige habe ich noch nicht gebraucht und weiß deshalb nicht wie wichtig sie wirklich ist.
Wenn man ein Ladekabel fürs Auto sucht und nichts gegen einen Zusatznutzen hat: Klare Kaufempfehlung."

When start driving the app will not connect to the zus charger and will show me as I am getting away from the car when I'm actually driving the car. 
Simply a disappointment!!"

I am of the age where it is not uncommon to forget where I parked at. ZUS directs me to my car quickly. My car was totaled recently and one thing I was sure to grab out of my old one was my ZUS. it soon came in handy when I had to take my new car in for an after market add on. I could not find my car where they told me it was parked. Looked at my ZUS on my phone and found it in a different area in seconds. 

I also love the two charging ports and cables for fast phone charging. The cables are well made. I love ZUS!"

Every time I get the timer notification on my watch I have to switch to the phone to actually set a timer. Seems a good candidate for a watch app."
